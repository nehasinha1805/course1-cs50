 computational thinking:-
 input->algorithm-> output
 The extension of a file interprets the patterns of '1' and '0'. 
 eg., png extension interprets that '1' & '0' should show an image.
 
C++ NOTES:-
C++ provides a data structure, the array, which stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it can be think that an array is a collection of variables of the same type.

Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.

All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.
